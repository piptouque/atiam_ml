The advantage of neural networks is that the same principle can be applied in a *layer-wise* fashion. This allows to further discriminate the space in sub-regions (as seen in the course). We will try to implement the 2-layer *perceptron* that can provide a solution to the infamous XOR problem. The idea is now to have the output of the first neurons to be connected to a set of other neurons. Therefore, if we take back our previous formulation, we have the same output for the first neuron(s) $y$, that we will now term as $y_{1}$. Then, we feed these outputs to a second layer of neurons, which gives\n",

    "Finally, we will attack a complete audio classification problem and try to perform neural network learning on a set of audio files. The data structure will be the same as the one used for parts 1 and 2. As discussed during the courses, even though a 2-layer neural network can provide non-linear boundaries, it can not perform \"holes\" inside those regions. In order to obtain an improved classification, we will now rely on a 3-layer neural network. The modification to the code of section 3.2 should be minimal, as the back-propagation will be similar for the new layer as one of the two others. We do not develop the math here as it is simply a re-application of the previous rules with an additional layer (which derivatives you should have generalized in the previous exercise).  \n",
